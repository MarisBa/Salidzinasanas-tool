# Sanctions Comparison Tool

A sanctions comparison tool built with **PHP** and **Node.js**.  
It fetches the official **UN Security Council Consolidated Sanctions List** from an XML source and allows users to upload their own data files (**TXT, CSV, XLSX**) for comparison. The system highlights matches, displays the list in alphabetical order, and provides export options (CSV, PDF, Print) to simplify compliance and data verification.
